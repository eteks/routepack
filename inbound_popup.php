Warangal, located in Telangana is a beautiful city with a glorious past. We find that many places gain the attention of tourists with one or two spectacular spots that are world famous. On the other side, we find certain places that have historical importance, stunning landscape and yet not on the top list on tourists’ favorite destinations. Only few places enjoy the best of both worlds. They possess natural beauty, man made wonders and are widely recognized. Warangal has its own strengths being culturally rich and blessed with abundance by Mother Nature.</span>
