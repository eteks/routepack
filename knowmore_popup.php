			<span>India is rapidly growing as a magnificent tourist attraction among all the local and international tourists. Enjoying the perfect weekend in the enchanting and awe-inspiring places is certainly a rising trend in the metro cities today. People of Delhi often wish to celebrate their weekend away from the hustle-bustle of the city. Delhi is well connected with many prominent tourist attractions that refresh the mind, body and soul.Home to one of the 7 wonders of the world, Taj Mahal, Agra is a sneak peek into the architectural history with other structures such as Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri and hence makes for a must visit for anyone living in or visiting India.Jaipur, the capital of India’s Rajasthan state, evokes the royal family that once ruled the region and that, in 1727, founded what is now called the Old City, or “Pink City” for its trademark building color. At the center of its stately street grid (notable in India) stands the opulent, collonaded City Palace complex, which today houses several museum collections of textiles and art.Shimla is the capital of the northern Indian state of Himachal Pradesh, in the Himalayan foothills. Once the summer capital of British India, it remains the terminus of the narrow-gauge Kalka-Shimla Railway, completed in 1903. It’s also known for the handicraft shops that line The Mall, a pedestrian avenue, as well as the Lakkar Bazaar, a market specializing in wooden toys and crafts.
